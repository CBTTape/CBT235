//***FILE 235 IS AN LPA/SVC REAL TIME LOADER AND REPLACEMENT AND    *   FILE 235
//*          PERFORMANCE TOOL FROM CHYRSLER PARTS.                  *   FILE 235
//*          MODULE CONCEPTS:  REAL TIME, MLPA SIMULATION, SVC      *   FILE 235
//*           REPLACEMENT AND MODULE FIXING (FOR PERFORMANCE AND    *   FILE 235
//*           EASE OF IN-CORE ZAP).                                 *   FILE 235
//*           THIS MODULE IS PAGEABLE.                              *   FILE 235
//*           LOADED MODULES AND SVCS ARE PLACED IN FIXED CSA       *   FILE 235
//*           MEMORY.                                               *   FILE 235
//*           WHY IN FIXED MEMORY ?                                 *   FILE 235
//*           1) TYPE 1 AND 2 SVC'S MUST BE RESIDENT IN THE         *   FILE 235
//*              NUCLEUS (OR AT LEAST APPEAR TO BE SO).             *   FILE 235
//*           2) AS THIS IS A TEST TOOL, THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT     *   FILE 235
//*              IN-CORE ZAPS MAY BECOME NECESSARY AND YOU ARE      *   FILE 235
//*              ASSURED THE MODULE WILL BE IN CORE AT ALL TIMES    *   FILE 235
//*              (NOT PAGED OUT).                                   *   FILE 235
//*           3) FOR PERFORMANCE TESTING, A DUPLICATE COPY OF A     *   FILE 235
//*              CURRENTLY PAGEABLE MODULE MAY BE RE-LOADED, AND    *   FILE 235
//*              YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EXAMINE THE PERFORMANCE GAINS  *   FILE 235
//*              THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE PERMANENT FIXING OF THE   *   FILE 235
//*              MODULE VIA IEAFIXXX.                               *   FILE 235
//*                                                                 *   FILE 235
//*           FOR ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION ON THIS PROGRAM SEE THE  *   FILE 235
//*           SOURCE CODE.                                          *   FILE 235
